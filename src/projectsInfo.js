    'ABOUT:  During a month long internship with Course Report, a group of 6 of us made a mobile app from scratch using react native. The current Course Report web app uses rails as their backend without CORS enabled as well as postgreSQL as the database. We created a proxy server with node/express to communicate with the rails backend so we would not have enable CORS on the main rails backend and so data could be cleaned up before being sent to the client. We also used redis with our proxy server in order to cache school and blog data which sped up loading time by 80%. The app features search capabilities and leverages phone location data to find the nearest schools to the user.'

The app features a full user signup/login process as well as authorization/authentication using JSON web token and bcrypt. The styling is done using ReactStrap and Bootstrap. Animations are used to various places to enhance the user experience as well as give feedback on loading. The backend is built in Node/Express and the frontend is built in React. PostgreSQL is the database that is used. Unit and integrations tests are written using jest. Feel free to check out the github link for all the code as well as the external link to a live hosted site.`,

The current comparison tool didnâ€™t look modern, and the code was jumbled and unclean. We worked to update the UI with a modern feel and made the tool web responsive so that it could be viewed on all platforms. We also object oriented the front end javascript so that the code was more modular and easy to expand in the future. We used jQuery for the frontend to do this.`,
